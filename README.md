# agjs - Awesome Guy Java Script

This game works well on Google Chrome from the 2017.03.01 time period (version 49.0.2623.75). Firefox works on the small screen only, the big screen lagging behind a second or two. If you are attached to Firefox disable the big screen and play on the small screen.

This game was originally designed for the Nintendo DS handheld gaming system as a homebrew project. The game had ten scrolling levels and used five buttons.

Almost immediately the game was ported to the Android phone. The first port for the Android phone was also used as an independent study for the Computer Science department at SUNY New Paltz. Later it was also revised several times. That version of the game had all the previous levels and also an eleventh level that sported some 3d opengl objects.

The version you are looking at was implemented entirely in html and javascript. It has ten levels. The opengl objects from the Android version were omitted. Also this version does not save your scores in any way.
